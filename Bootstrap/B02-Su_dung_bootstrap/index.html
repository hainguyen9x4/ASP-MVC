            One advantage of using the Bootstrap CDN:
Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

jQuery
Bootstrap uses jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need jQuery.
